This is an Etch-A-Sketch board where the user can change the size of the board and the color they draw on the board with.

Skills used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

This was my second project ever using JS and I had some difficulty but in the end I learned:
- How to make complex functions that call upon other functions to complete a task
- How to use the different types of event listeners

I also learned how to use some new HTML elements such as:
- Color picker
- Slider
